# /aire-hello-world

This directory contains my first forays into using the Aire cluster. It contains basic scripts used to verify that SLURM jobs were properly submitted with respect to core and node allocation.

Through this, I learned more about SLURM and MPI in particular.

It could possibly serve as a useful quick reference if I need to do these tasks again in the future, though they're certainly no substitute for the relevant documentation.
